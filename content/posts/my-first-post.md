Hello World!

Welcome to the sin.io blog about Software Infrastructure Networks, AI, 3D printing and more.

This is my first blog post in a long time! I finally got around to setting up GitHub Pages with Hugo.

I'm testing it out and I noticed that when I use today's date, February 29th, Hugo renders it as Jan 1st 0001 :-)

I will submit a bug report to the Hugo project.

This is the first blog post so it doesn't really matter, but if it weren't, then the ordering in the blog posts list would be wrong.
